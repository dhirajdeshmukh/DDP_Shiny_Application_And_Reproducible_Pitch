# Developing Data Product Week 4 Assignement - Shiny Application And Reproducible Pitch
This assignment is divided into THREE major sections.
1. Create Shiny App (using separate ui.R and SERVER.R files)
2. Deploy the Shiny App on server.
3. Create presentation (host on github or Rpubs) of 5 pages for the Shiny App. 

## Create Shiny App (using separate ui.R and server.R files)

   The shiny App named "irisapp" is created using ui.R and SERVER.R files which can be located at the below links provided -
   
   ui.R link - https://github.com/dhirajdeshmukh/DDP_Shiny_Application_And_Reproducible_Pitch/blob/master/ui.R
   
   server.R link - https://github.com/dhirajdeshmukh/DDP_Shiny_Application_And_Reproducible_Pitch/blob/master/server.R 
   
   Dataset for Shiny App can be located at About_Iris_dataset.md file in github:        
   https://github.com/dhirajdeshmukh/DDP_Shiny_Application_And_Reproducible_Pitch/blob/master/About_Iris_dataset.md
   
## Deploy the Shiny App on the server
   Link for IrisApp after it was deployed on the server: https://ddshmkh.shinyapps.io/irisapp/
   
## Presentation on Rpubs
   Presentation host on Rpubs: http://rpubs.com/dhirajdeshmukh/IrisHistogram
   
## Steps to execute - 
   "How to do it" file in github. provide the detail steps to create and run the application and also to create the presentation
<To do list>1. Create iris.xlsx file using the dataset of iris and copy it in github in Data folder.2. Remove Create a file named "About Iris Dataset.md" to include all details about the Iris Dataset.3. Add "How to do it" file in github4. Need to add the code for presentation? Where and how to get that code?5. Try changin the color in hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')  in SERVER.R file
