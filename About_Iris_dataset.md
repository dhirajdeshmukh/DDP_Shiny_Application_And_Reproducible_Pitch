# Data Source
 The dataset used in creating the App is the Iris Flower data set. 
 This dataset was first introduced by British statistician and Biologist Ronald Fisher. It is aka Fisher's Iris data set. Data set consist of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). And four features were measured from each sample: lengh and width of Sepals and Petals of Flowers in centimeters.   
 To use this data to create Shiny App, a data frame with 150 cases and 5 variables named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species are used.
 To access the data, the datasets package needs to be loaded and run the following command in R console.
 
 ##### library(datasets) 
 ##### data(iris) 
 ##### summary(iris) 
 ##### head(iris)
   
   ###### This dataset is also copied into Data/Iris.xlsx file in github.
